There are 2 main branches of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.

Descriptive statistics focuses on describing and summarizing the data at hand.
Example: after asking our friends how they get to work, we can see that:
- 50% drive to work
- 25% ride the bus
- 25% bike

Inferential statistics uses the data at hand, which is called "sample date", to make inferences about a larger population.

We could use inferential statistics to figure out what percent of people drive to work based on our sample data.

There are 2 main types of data: numeric (quantitative) and categorical (qualitative).

Numeric (or quantitative) data is made up of numeric values.

Categorical, or qualitative data is made up of values that belong to distinct groups.

It's important to note that these aren't the only two types of data.
